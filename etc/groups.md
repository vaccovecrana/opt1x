The overall objective is to keep things as simple as possible, with more advanced features always being opt-in.

Simplicity and minimalism is key to Opt1x.

- Namespaces are the primary containers of internal system structures (currently just values and configurations).
- A new group entity (OtGroup) will contain a series of RBAC roles that dictate what that group is allowed to do with namespace resources (i.e. CRUD on values and configs, and perhaps reading audit data for some groups.).
- There will be a single "root" group: `/o1x`, which can do anything in the system.
- API keys will be assigned to only a single group. And the Opt1x `root` key will always be assigned to the `root` group.
- A sysadmin in possession of the root API key can configure groups, assign group roles, and create API keys for applications, and assign them to groups.

That's where basic Opt1x functionality ends.

Now, if the sysadmin enables OIDC integration, then:

- OIDC identity assignment and group mapping can be configured by the sysadmin to examine claims from an external OIDC provider.
- This mapping will allow the OIDC provider to tell Opt1x which groups get assigned to people logging into Opt1x via OIDC.
- One API key can be tied to a single OIDC identity.

--------------------------

Here's the system/user story. Let me know if it's covered by the RBAC model.

Mark is a solo entrepreneur. He's working on his SaaS product: Flooper. Since Mark is doing everything himself, he just needs a few things from Opt1x:

- A root API key to manage everything (i.e. make namespaces, edit config values and build config trees).
- 3 system API keys with read-only access to the config trees, say `flooper-dev`, `flooper-stage` and `flooper-prod`.

Mark then successfully launches Flooper, and it gets sold to a mega corp: Bimblar Inc. which takes ownership of all of Flooper's IT assets.

Mark hands over the root API key to Larry, Bimblar's IT/InfoSec guy, who will now manage Opt1x. Mark is now out of the picture, since he no longer owns Flooper.

However Larry will not directly manage the Flooper product itself, only Opt1x.

Flooper will now be maintained and developed by Steve, an Engineering manager at Bimblar, alongside his new Flooper team.

Larry will connect Opt1x to Okta (the IDP used at Bimblar to grant/revoke app access) so that Steve can log into Opt1x.

However Larry has a million other things to do, so he only sets enough permissions for Steve to do whatever his team needs in the single `/o1x/flooper` root namespace that Mark originally created.

That's the parent namespace of these three namespaces:

- `/o1x/flooper/flooper-dev`
- `/o1x/flooper/flooper-stage`
- `/o1x/flooper/flooper-prod`

Lastly, Larry will also configure access for Brenda, another InfoSec employee at Bimblar, so that she can audit *all* changes made to Opt1x (say for example she's going to feed that data to a super-duper AI system or something).

Steve can now do anything and everything in the `/o1x/flooper` namespaces. However, Steve also has a million things to do, so he needs to configure access for his team:

- Linda, internal Bimblar developer employee.
- Jerry, an external developer contractor.
- Ashok, an external SQE contractor.

Steve wants to delegate production support tasks to Linda, so both Steve and Linda should have read/write access into the `/o1x/flooper/flooper-prod` namespace.

Jerry and Ashok on the other hand, should only have read/write access to `/o1x/flooper/flooper-dev` and `/o1x/flooper/flooper-stage`, so that they can manage configurations as they develop and test new features for Flooper.

This of course means that Linda also has the same base level of access as Jerry and Ashok.

As time goes by Flooper, managed by Opt1x, catches the attention of the Bimblar CTO during a review with Larry.

The CTO then tells Michael, a huge UNIX beard, that his Kafka team could really benefit from managing their Kafka infrastructure using Opt1x.

Michael decides to give it a try, and following the same pattern, Larry now creates 4 more namespaces:

- `/o1x/bmb-kafka`
- `/o1x/bmb-kafka/bmb-kafka-dev`
- `/o1x/bmb-kafka/bmb-kafka-stage`
- `/o1x/bmb-kafka/bmb-kafka-prod`

Once this is done, Larry onboards Michael through Okta, so that Michael can manage anything in those namespaces, and moves on.

Next, Flooper now needs to start pushing, say, things like user signups or sales records into Kafka, so that other applications can work with that data.

Steve and Michael meet to basically say: "Hey, I need you to give me read-only access into the `/o1x/bmb-kafka/bmb-kafka-stage` and `/o1x/bmb-kafka/bmb-kafka-prod` namespaces, so that me and my team can configure Flooper to connect to your Kafka bus".

Steve's team does no need (and shouldn't have) access to `/o1x/bmb-kafka` or `/o1x/bmb-kafka/bmb-kafka-dev`, because that's for Michael's team to fiddle around with new features, and so that environment isn't guaranteed to be stable at all times.

Michael agrees, and grants Steve access into the namespaces. However, which people in Steve's team will also have read-only access to the kafka namespaces is left to Steve's discretion, since Michael doesn't care about that.

-------------------------

The RBAC model you've outlined is a solid, minimalist foundation that aligns well with Opt1x's ethos—simple core with opt-in extensions. It emphasizes namespaces as the central access boundary, uses groups for permission bundling, and keeps OIDC as a pluggable layer for identity mapping. This avoids over-engineering while supporting basic hierarchies and delegation. The model covers the core of the user story (solo dev → enterprise handover → team collaboration), but there are a few gaps in flexibility for multi-role users and cross-team access, which I'll highlight with proposed tweaks. Overall, it's sane and extensible without bloat.

I'll first confirm how the model handles the story, then answer your specific questions (Okta groups needed, join/leave handling), and end with proposed changes.

### Sanity Check: Does the Model Cover the User Story?

Yes, mostly—it supports the progression from solo use to enterprise with minimal friction:

- **Mark's Solo Setup**: Root key (in root group) manages everything. Create 3 system keys assigned to a basic "ReadOnlyConfigs" group with read-only roles for specific namespaces (`flooper-dev/stage/prod`). This is covered by root's ability to create keys and assign groups.
- **Handover to Larry**: Larry (with root key) enables OIDC (opt-in), configures claims mapping (e.g., Okta groups → Opt1x groups). He creates a "FlooperManagers" group with full CRUD on `/flooper*` namespaces, assigns Steve via Okta.
- **Larry Onboards Steve and Brenda**: Larry creates "InfoSecAuditors" group for Brenda (read audit logs across all namespaces). Steve gets "FlooperManagers" for full `/flooper` access.
- **Steve Delegates to Team**: Steve (via UI/API with his key) creates keys for Linda/Jerry/Ashok, assigning to groups like "FlooperProdSupport" (RW on all `/flooper*`) for Linda, and "FlooperDevStage" (RW on `/flooper-dev/stage` only) for Jerry/Ashok. This uses group roles for namespace-specific CRUD.
- **Michael's Kafka Setup**: Larry creates `/bmb-kafka*` namespaces and "KafkaManagers" group (full CRUD on those). Onboards Michael via Okta mapping.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration (Flooper → Kafka)**: Michael grants Steve read-only access to `/bmb-kafka-stage/prod`. But here's a gap: Your model ties keys to one group, so Steve's key (in "FlooperManagers") can't easily gain partial access to Kafka namespaces without a new group/key or multi-group support. Steve could create read-only keys for his team and share them, but that's clunky—not ideal for dynamic collaboration.

Strengths:

- Minimal: Starts with API keys; OIDC adds identity without mandating it.
- Secure: Root controls groups/keys; namespaces limit blast radius.
- Opt-In: OIDC only for enterprises like Bimblar.

Weaknesses (Addressed in Proposals Below):

- Single-group-per-key limits users needing mixed permissions (e.g., Steve as Flooper manager + Kafka reader).
- Cross-team grants require manual key creation/sharing; no direct "grant to user/group" mechanic.
- Audit for Brenda is good, but ensure roles include "read audit" explicitly.

### Necessary Groups in Okta for Collaboration

Okta (as the IDP) would manage user assignments externally, with OIDC claims (e.g., a "groups" array claim) passing group names to Opt1x on login. Opt1x maps these to internal OtGroup (e.g., via claim matching). This keeps Opt1x simple—no user storage, just sync on auth.

To support the story, an Okta admin (Larry) would create these Okta groups (user-assignable via Okta dashboard). Each Okta group maps 1:1 (or via regex) to an Opt1x OtGroup with corresponding roles:

1. **RootAdmins**: For Larry (and backups). Maps to Opt1x root group (full system access: Create/manage groups, keys, namespaces; enable OIDC; all CRUD anywhere).
2. **InfoSecAuditors**: For Brenda. Maps to Opt1x group with read-only audit roles (view all logs/changes system-wide; no CRUD on resources).
3. **FlooperManagers**: For Steve (and potentially Linda if elevated). Maps to Opt1x group with full CRUD on `/flooper*` namespaces (create/edit values/configs; assign keys to sub-groups).
4. **FlooperProdSupport**: For Linda (and Steve if multi-group). Maps to Opt1x group with RW on all `/flooper*` (dev/stage/prod).
5. **FlooperDevStage**: For Jerry/Ashok (and Linda if multi-group). Maps to Opt1x group with RW on `/flooper-dev` and `/flooper-stage` only; read-only or no access to prod.
6. **KafkaManagers**: For Michael. Maps to Opt1x group with full CRUD on `/bmb-kafka*`.
7. **KafkaReaders**: For cross-team (Steve/Linda). Maps to Opt1x group with read-only on `/bmb-kafka-stage/prod` (no dev access, assuming sensitivity).

- **Okta Config Notes**: In Okta Admin > Applications > Opt1x OIDC App > Sign On > Edit ID Token: Add "groups" claim with filter (e.g., regex "^(RootAdmins|InfoSec.*|Flooper.*|Kafka.*)$" to include only relevant groups as an array). This ensures claims pass multiple groups per user if needed.
- **Why These Groups?**: They mirror team/namespace boundaries, enabling delegation (Steve creates sub-groups/keys). Cross-team uses a dedicated reader group for minimal privilege.

Total: 7 groups—keeps it simple, scalable via regex if more teams added.

### Handling Join/Leave in the RBAC Model

The model handles this elegantly via OIDC sync (opt-in) and manual key management (core):

- **Joining a Team**:

  - Okta admin (Larry) adds user to Okta group(s) (e.g., add Linda to "FlooperProdSupport" and "FlooperDevStage").
  - On next OIDC login to Opt1x: Claims include the groups array. Opt1x maps to internal OtGroup(s), generating/linking an API key (one per identity, as per your model) with permissions from the union of groups.
  - If no OIDC: Manual—root/admin creates key, assigns to group.
  - System Keys: Unchanged (no identity tie); assign to read-only groups manually.

- **Leaving a Team (or Termination)**:

  - Okta admin removes user from group(s) (e.g., remove Jerry from "FlooperDevStage" on contract end).
  - Immediate: Next OIDC login fails for those permissions (claims lack group → Opt1x denies mapped roles).
  - Revocation: If webhook/SCIM enabled (opt-in), Okta pushes "deactivated" event to Opt1x → Auto-revoke linked API key (set deletedAtUtcMs, cascade to children).
  - Without webhook: On next validation (e.g., cron or request), Opt1x checks claims/missing groups → Revoke key.
  - Fallback (No OIDC): Manual revocation by admin (e.g., Steve revokes Jerry's key via UI).
  - Audit: Log all changes (e.g., "Key revoked due to group removal").

This is low-maintenance—Okta handles lifecycle; Opt1x reacts via claims/events. For termination, window is token TTL (<1 hour); use short sessions.

### Proposed Changes to the RBAC Model

Your model is 80% there, but add these for better coverage (keep opt-in where possible):

1. **Allow Multiple Groups per API Key/User**: Change "API keys assigned to only a single group" to multiple (e.g., OtKeyGroup table for many-to-many). Permissions = union of group roles. Why? Handles multi-role users (e.g., Linda in ProdSupport + DevStage; Steve in FlooperManagers + KafkaReaders). OIDC claims array maps naturally. Minimal impact: Add linking table/DAO.
2. **Explicit Cross-Namespace Grants**: Add a way to grant specific namespace access to external groups/users (e.g., extend OtKeyNamespace to reference OtGroup). Why? For Steve/Michael collaboration—Michael grants "FlooperManagers" read-only to Kafka subsets without new keys. Opt-in via UI ("Share Namespace" button).
3. **Role Granularity per Group**: Define roles as namespace-scoped enums (e.g., ReadValues, WriteConfigs, ReadAudit). Groups bundle these with wildcards (e.g., RW on `/flooper*`). Why? Fine-tunes story (e.g., Brenda: ReadAudit system-wide; Jerry: WriteValues on `/flooper-dev` only).
4. **OIDC Mapping Enhancements**: Allow configurable claim parsing (e.g., regex for Okta groups → Opt1x groups). One key per identity is fine, but auto-generate/rotate on login if expired. Opt-in: Toggle for "Require OIDC for Humans" (API keys still for systems).
5. **Root Safeguards**: Root group auto-created; limit root key usage (e.g., UI warns "Use for setup only").

These keep minimalism: Core is API-key driven; OIDC/groups add layers. Story is fully covered with these—solo to collaborative enterprise. If implementing, start with multi-group support.
